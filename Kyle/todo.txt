Todo list for Kyle:

1) Redo individual/group registration - Bring it into 2018, add some js validation and transitions and shit, kind of like the team registration

DD:
- Small group email templates weren't created using the gulp files in /email-templates
- League Skill Level is missing (at least for ultimate). This should be coming from the config table in the db.

- Create a page in the control panel for editing config items - I started working on converting the control panel to use the PHPSlim system (http://data.perpetualmotion.org/web-app/control-panel/standings/unbalanced-standings). I would prefer the new page for this is done through the same system.
- Start converting control panel to new system

- Start fixing DB configs that don't make sense. Individuals table shouldn't exist:
	- There should just be a flag on the players table to mark 'Is Individual'
	- Dates table doesn't actually save the date as a date in the db. It uses a series of strings
	- A score submission should contain the comment and spirit score, and there should be a 1 to n connection to another table for the individual match data (win, loss, tie, etc)
