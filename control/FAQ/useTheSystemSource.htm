                                the sport, season, and league then get the URL for the schedule page that was put online. On chrome, getting the URL entails going to the schedule page, 
                                right clicking the page, and selecting 'view
                                frame source.' On internet explorer, the best way i found was right clicking the page and selecting 'properties.' For both cases, you want the full URL
                                from the 'www.' to the '.htm'. Input this URL into the text box and press submit. To make sure it worked properly, check to see if there's an even amount of

                                open 'Load a schedule into the database' from the leagues menu, and punch in the data for your new league. When you enter in the new schedule data you 
                                will see all the weeks you submitted. You will also notice they are ordered 1, 2, 3, etc. which is probably wrong. What you want is to set those 
                                week numbers to whatever week they will be in the score reporter, then the score reporter and standings pages can keep running smooth.

                                are two teams with the same picture ID you can change one of them in their picture text box and press 'Update Teams' on the bottom of the form. Put the
                                pictures in the required folders and the league picture pages should figure it out from there. Of course for now there is still the tedious job of making
                                the new league link on the pictures main page... but you should know how to do that.

                                are associated with one of these tournaments. Also good to know is a tournament is defined by 'tournament_num_running,' this attribute separates ones years
                                tournament from another. To create a new tournament all together just add a row to the 'tournaments' database and fill in the columns as necessary.

                            	When I say Editing a tournament setup I mean stuff like, is registration for teams or players? Are there cards? What are the prices, when is it? etc.
                                To edit anything about the tournament go to 'edit a tournament' from the tournaments drop down. Punch in which tournament you want and change any of the
                                data as you see fit. I would recomment not touching 'num running' unless you're finishing one tournament and setting up next years. The rest is all very 
                                interactive and filled to the brim with javascript. The 'Extra Field' column is basically just for cities in Stall Fall currently, but if you want to add
                                any new thing to a tournament there's a good spot. It's good to note that I believe the extra field option only works with teams right now, sorry :). It
                                should also be good to note that is cards and is players are two different things. There are currently no setups of tournaments that only take players without
                                the card system but just in case one is made the functionality is there.<br /><br />Changings isTeams to isPlayers or isCards affects what shows up for
                                the registration pages, and the teams entered pages. Both those pages are coded to work with all three so total control is given to the create tournaments
                                page.

                            	Editing a tournaments leagues means basically editing what teams are entered into the tournament and editing a little data about them. To edit this
                                information go to 'Edit a League' in the tournaments dropdown. Punch in your tournament and you're off to the races. From here you can change any data
                                anywhere, even add in new data, and when you click 'Submit Teams' on the bottom of the page, all information on the page is submitted. Make sure there
                                are no doubles of numbers in a league as this results in one of the teams not showing up anymore. It doesn't mean they're deleted from the database, just
                                change the numbers back and they'll show up again. To delete teams from here, check them off on the right of the screen then press 'Delete Checked Teams'
                                on the bottom of the page. The 'Printable Page' button merely shows all the teams in the tournament on a new page in a more printer friendly format. The
                                'Email League' links on the page are for emailing all the captains in each league. These work if GMail is the default mailto program, however outlook
                                seems to like being the default so if it is, these links don't work very well.

                                find the team you want in 'Edit a League' and click the 'edt' button beside their team name. This will bring you to a new screen where you can edit everything
                                I stated before. To change a team name enter in the new name beside the change team name button and press 'Change Team Name.' Changing a league is alot the
                                same, just click the new league and press 'Change League.' Before either of these buttons will submit they require reassurance by means of an 'are you sure'
                                popup window. By default the first player in the database hooked up to the team is considered the team captain. Therefore, to change the team captain
                                add a new player by filling in all the information on the bottom of the form and press 'Create Player.' After this, delete the first player that was considered
                                the captain before. Now the new player will show up on the leagues page with their email that you submitted earlier.
